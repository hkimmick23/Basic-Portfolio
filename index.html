    <p>Hi! I'm Heather Kimmick and I'm a writer living in Tucson, AZ. A writer learning to code may seem strange, but writing introduced me to coding. I was attempting to build a website for my writing, when I realized without any HTML or CSS knowledge creating the website I wanted would be a tall order. </p>
    <p>I quickly picked up HTML and CSS from Codecademy. I started using my HTML knowledge to format ebooks and help friends with their websites. I realized coding is a lot of fun and I might use it to help other writers. I signed up for UA Full-Stack Bootcamp intending to use the skills I learned to help other writers create the websites of their dreams.</p>
    <p>I'm able to pursue this dream with the help of my partner (Doug), my three beagles(Malcolm, Ginny, and Charlie), and my three cats (Purrcy, Louis, and Claudia). </p>
